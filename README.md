# Windows Scoring Engine

The Windows Scoring Engine is a python program designed to aid in the scoring of Windows virtual images. It has a clean detection and output of vulnerabilities that are manually checked.

## Getting Started

Before zipping the folder off, make a copy of the python scoring engine file and change the top, global variables to fit what you desire. Then, download the Scoring Engine folder to a virtual image.

### Prerequisites

You will need a Windows system. Currently, the program has been tested to work on:

```
Windows 10
```

### "Installing"

If you are using the executable version, use Task Scheduler to schedule the exe to run on startup as Administrator.

Further instructions are below

```
foobar example
```

And repeat

```
until finished with example
```

Test the engine to see if it runs without errors.

## Running the tests

Use a pre-built image to test the vulnerabilities to ensure that the scoring engine is scoring correctly.
